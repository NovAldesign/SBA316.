Description: This website was created for people to study using a timer. This is resembles the pomodoro timer method. Peopel can determine their study goal and decide when to take a break. They can reset the timer or pause it depending on their needs. 

Applications Used:
CSS, HTML, and Javascript

Reflection:
What could you have done differently during the planning stages of your project to make the execution easier?

I think i needed to simplify my original idea. I wanted to had options to select how many break minutes they want to have. But I didn't get to add that feature.

Were there any requirements that were difficult to implement? What do you think would make them easier to implement in future projects?

I add issues with the timer aspect and setting the countdown connecting it with the buttons.

What would you add to, or change about your application if given more time?

If I need how to add api's I would have liked to add music to my app.

Use this space to make notes for your future self about anything that you think is important to remember about this process, or that may aid you when attempting something similar again:

Start with the MVP, and then add more as you go along and figure out the features you want to use.
